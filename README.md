# password_checker

Well, I think everyone of us wants to know if their password has ever been leaked. In my particulary case, I want. So I create a program to do that, because you know, probably you think, why would you ever create a program like that if there is on the internet already. The answer is simple. Everything you put on the internet, it remains in their database. So your password remains there. So why would I ever risk? Instead of this, I create my own program.
This is the most secure way for you to check if your password has ever been hacked.
